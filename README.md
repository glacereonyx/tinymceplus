# TinyMCEPlus
![Moodle CI Build Status](https://github.com/glacereonyx/tinymceplus/actions/workflows/moodle-ci.yml/badge.svg)
TinyMCEPlus brings back the TinyMCE integration for Moodle with an up to date version of TinyMCE. This text editor has a modern sleek look, and has many quality of life improvements over Moodle's Atto text editor.

You may prefer to use TinyMCEPlus if you are experiencing formatting or other issues with Atto, or just want to provide a improved user experience.

## Installation
To install this plugin, clone this repository to the `moodle/lib/editor` directory.
```bash
cd /var/www/moodle/lib/editor # replace this with the directory of your Moodle installation.
git clone https://github.com/glacereonyx/tinymceplus.git
```

## Moodle compatibility
TinyMCEPlus was developed for and has been tested on Moodle 3.11.
It should work on any version higher than this.

## Usage
1. As an admin, go to `Site administration > Plugins > Text editors > Manage editors`
2. Enable the TinyMCEPlus editor
3. Use the up/down arrows to move TinyMCEPlus to the top of the editors list to make it the default editor
4. The TinyMCEPlus editor will now appear as the text editor.

## Configuration
